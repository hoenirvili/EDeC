                <p class="three-paragraph">The words "ethics" and "morals" are frequently used interchangeably.
                    Ethics refer to behavior customary in our culture or society. Ethics may change as a person moves
                    from one society to the next.
                    Morals refer to personal standards of right and wrong. Morals do not change as a person moves from
                    one society to the next</p>

                <p class="three-paragraph">A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion
                    of policing
                    market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and
                    a business.
                    As of all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection takes on a clear political
                    significance.</p>

                    by becoming
